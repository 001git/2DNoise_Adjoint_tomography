# part-1:2DNoise_Adjoint_tomography

This is providing the final models, REGFs and codes in the paper:
Zhang C., Yao H., Liu Q., Zhang P., Yuan Y., Feng J., Fang L., 2018. Linear array ambient noise adjoint tomography reveals intense crust-mantle interactions in North China Craton.  J. Geophys. Res. , 123, DOI: 10.1002/2017JB015019


1 Finalmodel: the inverted Vs model: M14_Fang_final(Figure 8d), M23_Duan_final(Figure 10b)

2 REGFsï¼šreconstructed empirical green function (observed data)

3 seiscode: source code including two parts:

3.1) 3D/2D :the 3D/2D data transformation method

3.2) seisNoise2D :the 2D linear array ambient noise tomography

This is the source code without users' manual about how to use it. If you need a detail description, feel free to send an email to Chao Zhang (czhang18@mail.ustc.edu.cn) with a brief introduction about yourself and why you want to use it. We will be happy to help.

# part-2: Joint-inversion-based-on-adjoint-method

Following the workflow of part-1, we develope the joint inversion of ambient noise and teleseismic body-wave for linear arrays based on adjoint tomography.
