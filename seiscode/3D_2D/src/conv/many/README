Seismic format conversion tools
============================================================================

General format conversion
-------------------------

The programs in this subdirectory make use of libdatrwxx and support reading
and writing of various seismic formats.

any2any

  Converts files for any input format supported by lindatrwxx reading modules
  to any output format supported by libdatrwxx writing modules. This program
  not at all is SFF specific.

any2ascii

  Converts files to ASCII for any input format supported by lindatrwxx reading
  modules.

any2sff

  Converts files to SFF for any input format supported by lindatrwxx reading
  modules.

anyindex

  Create index files for any format supported by lindatrwxx reading modules.

anyextract

  Evaluates the anyindex output files for data completeness and extracts
  specific subsets of the data based on time window and channel and station
  codes. This program is able to string time series (data blocks) of the same
  data stream to one long time series. It perform consistency checks and is
  able to identify duplicate samples and gaps in the input. A special option
  is provided to produce a liast of contiguous data time windows as listed in
  the input index file.

Most programs support an online help options. Just call the
program without any option to get a hint.

============================================================================

Installation:

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See
https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh
for general installation instructions.

The Makefile supports program compilation and linking. Some binary libraries
are required. 

The command
  make all
will compile and install the binary executables as well as the doxygen
documentation.

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:
  LOCLIBDIR           defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR       defines location of C/C++ header files (prototypes)
  LOCBINDIR           defines location of binary executables
  TF_WWWBASEDIR       defines location of doxygen output

Dependencies:
  Compilers required to build the programs:
    C++ compiler
    C/C++ preprocessor
    doxygen (required to process source code documentation)
  
  Seitosh libraries required to compile the code:
    libgsexx
    libaff
    libtime
    libsffxx
    libdatrwxx
    libtfxx

   Further non-standard libraries required to compile the code:
    libboost_regex

   anyextract any2sff anyindex
    require: libsffxx.a libtime++.a libgsexx.a libaff.a libtfxx.a
             libdatrwxx.a

   anyextract
     additionally requires: libboost.a
