Reflectivity tools
============================================================================

Programs in this directory are tools and utilities to support seismogram
synthesis using the reflectivity method.

available programs:
===================
programs marked as "inactive" currently are not maintained

 makesrc.f (inactive)
   produces synthetic source time functions like the Müller-Brüstle wavelet
   and writes the resulting time series to a file

 momte.f
   calculate moment tensor elements from strike, rake, and slip given for an
   earthquake

 queko.f
   calculate epicentral distance and backazimuth for source and receiver
   coordinates given in geographical coordinates on the sphere

 refmet control files for global seismology
 ------------------------------------------
 cmt2refmet.f
   reads CMT file describing a CMT solution for global earthquakes and
   produces a source file with moment tensor to be used in refmet

 rcvgen.f
   produce a refmet receiver control file from a given source coordinate and
   a set of station coordinates in geographical coordinates on the sphere

 reflectivity expansion coefficients
 -----------------------------------
 amppg.f (inactive)
   plot expansion coefficients calculated by refmat

 matls.f (inactive)
   dump layout of expansion coefficient file produced by refmat

 reamp.f (inactive)
   reads a coefficient file, which probably has to be produced by refmat,
   and stores the values in a different format after some reflectivity
   processing - honestly, I do not remember the purpose of this program
  
 earth model file manipulation
 -----------------------------
 chopmod.f (inactive)
   reads an earth model file in GEMINI (Friederich and Dalkolmo, 1995) format,
   applies a flat earth approximation and produces an appropriate
   approximation by a model of discrete homogeneous layers

 flamop.f
   plots a flat earth model produced by chopmod

 flamops.f
   reads a flat earth model file and plots the equivalent spherical
   earth model

 gem2asc.f (inactive)
   reads an earth model file in the GEMINI (Friederich and Dalkolmo, 1995)
   format and produces an ASCII table of model parameters as output

 gemmodpg.f
   reads an earth model file in the GEMINI (Friederich and Dalkolmo, 1995)
   format and produces a plot of model parameter curves

 modrecipes.f
   convert refmet earth model files between different recipes of defining
   viscoelastic model parameters (see Forbriger and Friederich, 2005)
