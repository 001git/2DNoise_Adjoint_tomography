Reflectivity method by Joahim Ungerer (1990) - utility library
============================================================================

This subdirectory contains utility functions for the program refmet
(Reflectivity method implemented by Joahim Ungerer). Some of these functions
(primarily file i/o functions) are also by other programs. They are provided
through library librefread.a

Source code in this subdirectory:
(Check Makefile for functions included in librefread.a)

usage texts for main programs
  sub/refmat_basinf.f
  sub/refmet_basinf.f
  sub/refmet_comments.f (included from librefpar)
  sub/refmet_intro.f    (included from librefpar)
  sub/refmet_preptrace.f
  sub/resus_basinf.f
  sub/resusnoise_basinf.f

Fortran interface to C Bessel functions
  sub/lmath.c

Time series output functions
  sub/refmet_output.f
  sub/refmet_wtrace.f

Functions to read configuration files
  sub/refmet_rmain.f

  sub/refmet_rmod.f     (included from librefpar)
  sub/refmet_rrcv.f     (included from librefpar)
  sub/refmet_rsource.f  (included from librefpar)

On 24/09/2014 some of the source files (as indicated above) were moved to a
dedicated library package called librefpar.

Installation
------------

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.

The Makefile supports program compilation and linking. Some binary libraries
are required.

The command
  make all
will compile and install the binary executables.

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:
  LOCLIBDIR           defines location of binary libraries

Dependencies:
  Compilers required to build the programs:
    Fortran compiler
