Programs in this subdirectory provide means to calculated travel times of
refracted waves.

lazek
  Takes a subsurface model of homogeneous non-dipping layers and a
  configuration file specifying receiver positions. Both files are given in
  the format used by the reflectivity program refmet. 

ttplot
  Takes a subsurface model of homogeneous dipping layers and produces a plot
  of travel time curves for refracted waves.
