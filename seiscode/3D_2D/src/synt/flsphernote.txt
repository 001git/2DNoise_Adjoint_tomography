notes concerning flspher
------------------------
$Id$
============================================================================

flgevas:
  this directory contains the flgevas code
  flgevas computes Fourier Bessel expansion coefficients
  based on GEMINI algorithms
  
  this code currently is not maintained

flmodes:
  this directory contains the flspher code together with code
  for conversion programs for flspher output
  I tried to migrate the code to gfortran (3.2.2010) but did
  not succeed. This code is in an undefined state

flsphertrad:
  this directory contains the flspher code to calculate eigenmodes for a flat
  and shallow subsurface model
  the Makefile is set up to use f2c. This does not work properly on 64bit
  CPUs but still appears to perform correctly on 32bit machines
  Compile the code on 32bit machines and link to target flspherstatic
  (statically linked with f2c library) copy the binary to your 64bit machine
  and that should work
  Since there are almost no 32bit systems available, I started the transition
  to gfortran compilation on 29.11.2011. This appears to be more elaborate
  than expected. Common blocks in the code are not in sync. f2c appears to
  have tolerated this. The situation must be resolved for gfortran compilation
  properly.

scanflspherfile and flspherplot
  are located in directory disper and should compile and perform correctly
