available filters (version 2016/03/19):
tre n      remove trend found in first n samples
           (n=0: use all samples)
avg n      remove average found in first n samples
           (n=0: use all samples)
han        apply hanning taper
fac f      scale with factor f
del t      delay by t seconds
nrm v      normalize to maximum amplitude v
add v      add v
fbl n1 n2 n3
           calculates average value for samples from first sample to sample e1
           and average from sample s2 to e2; removes linear trend from time
           series such that both average value become zero
           e1: e1=n1 or e1=1 if n1=0
           e2: e2=n3 or e2=last sample if n3=0
           s2: s2=e2-n2 or s2=e2-n1 if n2=0
rev        reverse time series
sqr        take square of signal
pow exp    take each sample to the power of exp
sqt        take square root of signal
rec        rectify signal
cus        calculate cumulative sum
iset n1,n2,v
           set samples n1-n2 to value v
noi a      add Gaussian random noise of rms amplitude a
lof        load filters effectively with value of first sample by subtracting
           first sample from entire series
rsf        restore first sample, if lof was used previously
