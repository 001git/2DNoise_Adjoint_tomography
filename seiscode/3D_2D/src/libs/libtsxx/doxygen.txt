 * \since 2003
 *
 * This library provides modules for time series analysis.
 * In particular this are functions that also need seismic trace header data
 * (like the sampling interval) additional to the time series samples
 * themselves.
 * Provided are recursive filters (i.e. an interface to seife), FIR decimating
 * filters, interpolation filters, tapers, containers for time series data
 * together with header data, and more.
