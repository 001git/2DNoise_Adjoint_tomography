FAPIDXX --- Fortran API to libdatrwxx
============================================================================

For compilation instructions see README.md and INSTALL.md in the root
directory or
https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh/wikis/home

The aim of this library is to provide Fortran 77 code written to be linked
against libsff.a with the full functionality in libdatrwxx.a.

Installation
------------
 environment variables:
  LOCINCLUDEDIR   Defines the path where header files will be copied for
                  usage in your own projects. You will pass this path to
                  the precompiler with the -I option.
  LOCLIBDIR       Defines the path where the binary library will be
                  placed.
  TF_WWWBASEDIR   Defines the path to your personal homepage. That's the
                  place where doxygen output will be written too (see
                  in the Makefile).

make all             installs headers, binary libraries and documentation

Dependencies
------------
This library requires code from libdatrwxx libaff libgsexx libtime++ libsffxx.

Detailed documentation is provided through doxygen source code. See target
doxydoc in the Makefile.
