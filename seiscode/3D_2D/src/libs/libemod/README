EMOD  --- earth model library 
============================================================================

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.

libemod is a collection of Fortran 77 functions and subroutines to handle
seismological Earth models or subsurface models. The library provides
subroutines to read subsurface models in different text file formats.
Additionally, the library provides function to apply a flat-earth-
approximation as published by G. Mueller, 1977, J. Geophys., 42, 429-43
