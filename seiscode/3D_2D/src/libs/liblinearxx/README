LINEARXX ---  provide access to LAPACK for AFF modules 
============================================================================

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.

This library provides a C++ interface to LAPACK. It uses libaff arrays to 
store matrix data. The library builds a framework to be extended in the 
future with further interface functions to LAPACK.

Installation
------------
 environment variables:
  LOCINCLUDEDIR   Defines the path where header files will be copied for
                  usage in your own projects. You will pass this path to
                  the precompiler with the -I option.
  LOCLIBDIR       Defines the path where the binary library will be
                  placed.
  TF_WWWBASEDIR   Defines the path to your personal homepage. That's the
                  place where doxygen output will be written too (see
                  in the Makefile).

make all          installs headers, binary libraries and documentation

Dependencies
------------
This library requires code from libaff.
External dependencies are lapack gsl blas gslcblas.
The testprogram requires libtfxx in addition.


Detailed documentation is provided through doxygen source code. See target
doxydoc in the Makefile.
