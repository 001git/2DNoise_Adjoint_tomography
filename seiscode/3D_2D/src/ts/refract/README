refract
============================================================================

This directory and its subdirectories contain the source code for the
program refract. Targets are:

refract:   plot a section from an SFF data file

refractx:  uses the C++ reading library and provides additional
           data format for this reason


============================================================================

This program produces waveform plots arranging the traces along an offset
axis. Different line styles and colors are supported to visually compare data
from different data sets. Arrival times as well as a refracted wave
travel-time curves can be picked. The program is able to infer layer
velocities for 1D structures where seismic velocity increases with depth. It
plots synthetic travel times for 1D models. The program can be used to pick
offset dependent waveform taper definitions.

Features of refract and refractx:

 * interactive as well as non-interactive plotting
 * graphics output through PGPLOT  featuring a variety of devices and
   graphics formats (including Postscript, X11, Tektronix, PNG, GIF, etc)
 * ability to read a variety of input formats including SeismicUn*x
   and raw ASCII (through libdatrwxx)
 * appearance of plots controlled by many parameters (color, line width, etc)
 * plotting on a velocity reduced time scale
 * comparison of shallow seismic shot data with true amplitudes
 * display of synthetic arrival times of refracted and reflected waves
   together with waveforms

Installation 
------------ 

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.

The Makefile supports program compilation and linking. Some binary libraries
are required.

The command
  make all
will compile and install the binary executables as well as the
documentation.

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:
  LOCLIBDIR       defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR   defines location of C/C++ header files (prototypes)
  LOCBINDIR       defines location of binary executables
  TF_WWWBASEDIR   defines location of doxygen output (used by some libraries)

Dependencies:

required libraries:

libtf.a:    package libtf
libsff.a:   package libsff
libsffu.a:  package libsffu
libtime.a:  package libtime
libts.a:    package libts
These five packages can be obtained from where you got this package.

refractx additionally requires:
  libfapidxx.a
  libdatrwxx.a
  libsffxx.a
  libgsexx.a
  libtime++.a
  libaff.a
refractx further links against the C++ standard library (libstdc++.a)

PGPLOT Graphics Subroutine Library by T. J. Pearson version 5.2
can be obtained from: www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/
  libpgplot.a:      gfortran-version of library
