Purpose of lisousi
==================

Line-source simulation: Transform field data to apparent line-source generated
waveforms in preparation for Cartesian 2D full-waveform inversion.

Seismic field data is excited by point sources (e.g. hammer blows).
Full waveform inversion (FWI) approaches which make use of Cartesian 2D
forward modeling implicitly use a line source to fit the observed data.
Therefore recorded waveforms must be transformed to simulate equivalent
line-source generated data prior to application of 2D FWI.

lisousi offers several single-trace approaches for vertical component and
radial component data excited by vertical hammer blows or explosions.
Single-trace approaches can be applied to each seismic trace individually in
contrast to integral transform approaches, which require data from a complete
profile. Single-trace approaches have the benefit, that they are independent
of survey layout and that they perform reasonably well for data recorded on
laterally heterogeneous structures. On the downside they must estimate the
wave number from sample time and receiver offset. They inherently are
approximations, most of them being derived from the acoustic wave Green's
function. Nevertheless, they perform surprisingly well on data from
visco-elastic wave propagation in heterogeneous structures.

For shallow seismic data we recommend a simple but effective procedure:

 1. scale waveform by r*sqrt(2)    (offset times square root of 2)
 2. convolve with 1/sqrt(t)        (fractional half integration)
 3. taper samples with 1/sqrt(t)

Where r is source-to-receiver offset and t is sample time.
We call this "direct-wave transformation".

Theory of operation
===================

Lisousi in particular offers the following approaches as defined by Forbriger
et al. (2014, section 5) and tested by Sch√§fer et al. (2014, see definition in
section 2.2):
 - Single-velocity transformation
 - Direct-wave transformation
 - Reflected-wave transformation
 - Hybrid transformation

All approaches are based on the ratio of the 2D and the 3D Green's function
in the frequency domain (Forbriger et al. 2014, eq. 51). This ratio can be
understood as a convolution with 1/sqrt(t) in the time domain and appropriate
scaling (tapering) of the samples in the time domain (Forbriger et al. 2014,
eq. 52). The appropriate scaling factor depends on wave travel time and wave
travel distance, where only travel time can be deduced immediately from the
data.

Single-velocity transformation
------------------------------
  This approach is appropriate for wave propagation in homogeneous full space,
  where travel distance equals source to receiver offset and the average wave
  speed equals the actual (constant) wave speed. In this case the amplitude
  factor is taken to be (Forbriger et al. 2014, eq. 52)

    F = sqrt(2*r*v),

  where r is taken as the source to receiver offset (as provided in the data
  files) and v is the propagation velocity taken from the argument to option
  -velocity or its default value.

Direct-wave transformation
--------------------------
  This approach is appropriate for shallow seismic data, where sources as well
  as receivers are close to the free surface and data are dominated by direct
  waves or surface waves. In this case the amplitude factor is taken to be
  (Forbriger et al. 2014, eq. 58)

    F = r*sqrt(2/t),

  where r is taken as the source to receiver offset (as provided in the data
  files) and t is the travel time of the wave (which equals the sample time in
  the data files).

Reflected-wave transformation
-----------------------------
  This approach is appropriate for body waves which are reflected at deep
  reflectors in structures where propagation velocity varies only weakly (when
  compared to shallow structures). In this case the amplitude factor is taken
  to be (Forbriger et al. 2014, eq. 56)

    F = v*sqrt(2*t),

  where v is the average propagation velocity taken from the argument to
  option -velocity or its default value and t is the travel time of the wave
  (which equals the sample time in the data files).

Hybrid transformation
---------------------
  This approch is a variant of the direct-wave transformation, where the 
  single-velocity transformation is used as a replacement at small offsets
  (Forbriger et al. 2014, sec. 6.2). This is necessary in cases, where the
  amplitude taper, which becomes singular at zero offset for the direct-wave
  transformation, otherwise would result in artefacts. The one is replaced by
  the other gradually over a given offset range.

The program offers options to select different ways of constructing the
1/sqrt(t) filter and the way this filter is applied. Application of the filter
(convolution with 1/sqrt(t)) and the application of the scaling (tapering with
1/sqrt(t)) are not commutative in a mathematical sense and the results may
differ for a different order of the application. However, residuals have not
yet been observed at a significant level in practical application. Some of the
options are not really of practical relevance due to more efficient and
equally accurate alternatives. For instance a time domain convolution is not
recommended. These options are primarily provided for experimental purposes.

Application of program control parameters
=========================================

Direct-wave transformation and reflected-wave transformation
------------------------------------------------------------
The default (with no option selected) is the "direct-wave transformation". Use
the option -sqrttaper to select the "reflected-wave transformation". Both
approaches convolve the seismograms with 1/sqrt(t) and are different with
respect to the time domain taper applied to the waveform data. Both operations
can be controlled by command line options.

  Application of filter (convolution with 1/sqrt(t)):
    1) Frequency domain application:
       recommended approach
       default; fastest approach
       Convolution with the 1/sqrt(t) filter response is done in the
       Fourier domain by multiplication with the analytically derived
       Fourier coefficients of the filter response function.

    2) Frequency domain application of dicrete Fourier transform:
       select option: -fdfilter
       The 1/sqrt(t) filter response is constructed in the time
       domain. Convolution with the time series is done in the
       frequency domain after FFT.

    3) Time domain application:
       slowest approach
       select option: -tdfilter
       The 1/sqrt(t) filter response is constructed in the time
       domain. Convolution with the time series is done in the
       time domain by discrete convolution.

    Options:
      For the frequency domain applications (1 and 2) the following
      options are available:
        -pad n    padding of time series

      The 1/sqrt(t) filter response becomes singular for t=0. This
      requires special measures for the approaches which construct
      the filter response in the time domain (2 and 3) in order to
      create a response which behaves equivalent to its analytical
      counterpart. The following options are available:
        -integshift t
        -notinteg
      If -nointeg is selected, the following options are available:
        -tshift f
        -tlim f
        -tfac f

  Application of the taper:
    By default 1/sqrt(t) is applied to the seismograms as a time-domain taper
    and the signals are scaled by r*sqrt(2). This is called the "direct-wave
    transformation".

    Option -sqrttaper selects sqrt(t) as taper function and scales
    seismograms additionally by a factor sqrt(2)*velocity. This is called the
    "reflected-wave transformation".

    Tapers are applied prior to filtering by default. Option -taperlast
    selects to taper the time series after filtering.

    Tapers are always constructed in the time domain. The default
    1/sqrt(t) taper is singular at t=0. This requires special
    measures to set up the taper appropriately, such that it behaves
    equivalent to its analytical counterpart. The following options
    are available:
        -integshift t
        -nointeg
    If -nointeg is selected, the following additional options are available:
      -tshift f
      -tlim f
      -tfac f
    They have a lesser (or even unnoticeable) impact when compared to their
    impact when constructing the filter resonse. This is because the portion
    of the time series (close to t=0) which would be affected by the
    close-to-singular taper usually is of small or vanishing amplitude.

    Sampling time is taken as travel time in order to determine the
    appropriate scaling (taper) factor. Since a finite bandwidth wavelet
    appears slightly after the ray-theoretical arrival in the seismogram,
    scaling factors are typically too small for near offset traces, where
    pulse duration is close to pulse travel time. The program offers the
    option -tapdel to apply a correction for this effect. -tapslo can be used
    to set an upper limit for tapdel at small offsets.

Single-velocity transformation
------------------------------
  select by option: -fredomain
  additional options:
    -velocity v
    -pad n

  Operation:
  A Fourier transform of the waveform is divided by the Fourier transform of
  the 3D Greens function and multiplied by the 2D Greens function. This
  approach works only for waves of a single given wave velocity. It is hence
  only appropriate for the impulse response in homogeneous full space, but
  also performs surprisingly well when applied to dispersive wavefields.

Hybrid transformation
---------------------
  select by option: -transition
