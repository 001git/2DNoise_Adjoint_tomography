outfile      name of output file to contain results
infile       input file
             t:T select traces T, where T may be any range
                 specification like '3-4' or '5,6,7-12,20'
             f:F specifies an input file format differing from
                 the format selected by "-type"

informational output:
-xhelp[=type] print detailed information regarding file formats
             if "type" is specified, just print text for file format "type"
-listexperimental 
             list experimental and non-operational options
-v           be verbose
-DEBUG       produce debug output

data file input and output:
-o           overwrite output
-type type   choose input file format (default: sff)
-Type type   choose output file format (default: sff)

filter alternatives:
default: Fourier domain application of analytic filter coefficents
-fdfilter    apply numerically derived Fourier coefficients of 1/sqrt(t)
-tdfilter    apply 1/sqrt(t) in the time domain by discrete convolution
-pad n       in the case of Fourier domain processing, the time series
             is padded with zeroes to factor n of the number of samples
             of the input series prior to the Fourier transformation

taper alternatives:
-taperlast   tapers are applied prior to filtering by default; this
             option selects to taper the time series after filtering
             If this option is selected, the order of the processing
             steps (which are not commutative) is reversed.
-sqrttaper   By default we use r*sqrt(2/t) as the taper and scaling
             function (direct-wave transformation). This is appropriate for
             direct waves. In the case of reflected waves commonly the
             propagation velocity is assumed to be known (see option
             -velocity). Then the scaling function is v*sqrt(2*t), where v is
             the assumed phase velocity (reflected-wave transformation).
             The latter is selected by this option.
-tapdel t    delay taper function by t seconds; this accounts for
             the finite duration of a band limited source signal
-tapslo s    delay taper by not more than s*offset, where s is a
             slowness in s/m; serves as an upper limit for tapdel
             at small offsets

1/sqrt(t) construction:
the default operation to handle the singularity at t=0 is:
  choose samples of 1/sqrt(t) such that they produce the
  same mean values as the continuous function when being
  integrated over one sampling interval
-integshift f shift time axis by a fraction f of the sampling interval
             in order to adjust centroid of integration interval
the following options are for experimental purposes only:
-nointeg     do not derive samples by integration; sample 1/sqrt(t)
             directly and optionally use the following parameters to
             control the bevahiour close to t=0
             deprecated method
if -nointeg is selected:
-tshift f    to avoid the singularity of 1/sqrt(t) at t=0, sampling time
             is shifted by a fraction f of the sampling interval
-tlim f      to avoid the singularity of 1/sqrt(t) at t=0, the sample
             time for samples at times smaller than f*dt, where dt is
             the sampling interval, is set to a given fraction of the
             sampling interval (see option -tfac)
-tfac f      to avoid the singularity of 1/sqrt(t) at t=0, the sample
             time at small times (see options -tlim) is set to a
             fraction f of the sampling interval

Single-velocity transformation:
-fredomain   apply transformation in the frequency domain for a
             single direct wave velocity.
-exact       apply the exact transformation for the single-velocity approach
             (Forbriger 2014, eq. 31); the default is to apply the far-field
             approximation (Forbriger 2014, eq. 30)

-velocity v  set assumed wave velocity in km/s

Hybrid transformation:
-transition r1,r2 mix both approaches; up to offset r1 the "single
             velocity transformation" is used; for offsets larger than
             r2 the "direct wave transformation" is used; in between
             both are mixed with continously varying percentage
             from one to the other

Additional options:
-limitlength some convolution schemes return a larger number of samples
             than present in the input series (due to padding for
             example); this option limits to numer of output samples
             to the number of input samples

-spatialdistance
             use spatial distance to source instead of offset along surface,
             whereever a distance is required
