sousou - locate sound source
============================================================================

Find SOUrce of air-coupled SOUnd wave
   
This program uses a slant stack correlation analysis of the air-coupled sound
wave to find the real shot location relative to the provided coordinate system
of the input profile. It was initially designed to help in cases where a
careless field operator missed to note the location of the seismic source in
the profile. The acoustic wave emitted by the source and recorded by the
geophones then can be used to locate the source in the profile.

Essentially, the program is designed to identify non-dispersive signals
present in a seismic profile. It can be used to determine the phase slowness
of these signals and to locate the coordinate at which the signals was present
at origin time.

Installation
------------

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.


The Makefile supports program compilation and linking. Some binary libraries
are required. 

The command
  make all
will compile and install the binary executables. 

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:
  LOCLIBDIR      defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR  defines location of C/C++ header files (prototypes)
  TF_WWWBASEDIR  defines location of doxygen output (used by some libraries)

Dependencies:
  
  extern libraries/packages needed to compile the code
    PGPLOT
    liblapack:      linear algebra package
    libblas:        basic linear algebra functions
  

  Seitosh libraries required to compile the code:
    libsff        provides libsff.a
    libtf         provides libtf.a
    libts         provides libts.a
    libfapidxx    provides libfapidxx.a libfapidxx.so
    libdatrwxx    provides libdatrwxx.a libdatrwxx.so
    libsffu       provides libsffu.a
    libtime       provides libtime_trad.a and libtime++.a
    libgsexx      provides libgsexx.a
    libsffxx      provides libsffxx.a
