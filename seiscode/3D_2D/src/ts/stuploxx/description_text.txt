stuploxx is a time series plot program. It is specifically designed to plot
signals on a date and time scale for observatory quality control. It supports
plotting on a fixed ordinate scale with chart stepping in order to provide a
signale independent amplitude reference. It features an automatic update
(repeat) mode as well as an interactive mode allowing for zoomed displays.

Graphics are created through PGPLOT. All PGPLOT escape sequences can be used
to control labels and other text elements. Data formats are supported as far
as implemented in libdatrwxx.

Monitor plots are supported in two different modes:
1. Interactive mode allows rereading of data files by pressing 'r'.
2. Repeat mode supports automatic update of data.

Further information can be requested through option --help:
