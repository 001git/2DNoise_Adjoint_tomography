============================================================================

Installation:

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.


The Makefile supports program compilation and linking. Some binary libraries
are required. 

The command
  make all
will compile and install the binary executables as well as the documentation.

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:
  LOCLIBDIR           defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR       defines location of C/C++ header files (prototypes)
  LOCBINDIR           defines location of binary executables

Dependencies
------------

required libraries:
  libgin:
    will be compiled by the Makefile in subdirectory libs
  libtf, librefpar, libgrrefsub (only for gremlin), 
    libwrefsub (only for wgremlin):
    are available from directory src/libs
    just call 'make install' in directory src/libs of your working copy
  libpgplot:
    is expected to be installed from external
  libblas, liblapack:
     are expected to be installed in some system library path

LaTeX (with pdflatex) is required to compile the documentation provided in
subdirectory docu.
