green/tools: some tools to manipulate wavefield expansion coefficients
============================================================================

Programs like greda, grepg, and gremlin use a special file format to exchange
values of Fourier-Bessel coefficients. Programs in this directory can be used
to manipulate these files:

gredi       calculate difference between expansion coefficients
grenorm     apply frequency dependent normalization factors
gretap      create a taper in the frequency phase-slowness domain
greto       downsample expansion coefficients in the frequency domain
magres      apply a taper in the frequency phase-slowness domain

==========================================================================

Installation
------------

This software is part of project Seitosh. See
https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh
for general installation instructions.

The Makefile supports program compilation and linking. Some binary libraries
are required. 

The command
  make all
will compile and install the binary executables. 

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:
  LOCLIBDIR           defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR       defines location of C/C++ header files (prototypes)

Dependencies:
  
  Seitosh libraries required to compile the code:
    libsff        provides libsff.a
    libtf         provides libtf.a
    libaff
