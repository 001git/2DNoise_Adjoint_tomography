29.11.2016: teseco

  - commit 575d93b15: provide new tolerance option -trim

22.11.2016: libtsxx, libtsioxx, cross

  - commit 18bd88a70: cross optionally operates in the Fourier domain which
    for large time series is computationally more efficient than time domain
    convolution or cross-correlation.
  - commit a7336a74f: Reorganize header files for libtsxx to properly separate
    class templates from error handling and specific type definitions.
!!! This can affect existing code, which no has to include additional files.
  - commit 9b6fe244a: Provide proper assignment and copy operators and type
    conversion for time series containers (libtsxx, libtsioxx).
  - commit 9cebce57b: Remove copy constructors which allowed implicit type
    conversion. Let users explicitly express their desire of type conversion.
!!! This can affect existing code, which no has to include additional files.

19.11.2016 (5f6902232): cross

  - ts/wf/cross now provides proper scaling and a reasonable definition of
    sample times in both modes (fixes issue #11)
  - ts/wf/cross now uses libdatrwxx and provides access to all
    supported input and output file formats

18.11.2016 (bf3f4664a): libdatrwxx

  Debug output is produced at the base class level. This way the workflow for
  reading and writing of any of the specific classes may be displayed, without
  the need to implement specific debug functions.

  Fix (d0d054df6): use signed integer when addressing series elements in
  oasciistream output function.

16.11.2016 (840f7e310): stuplo, stuplox

  Provide new option -st which adjusts sample time relative to source time.
  This is useful to display lag time for cross-correlograms.

15.11.2016 (739b3d40f): cooset

  Support all file formats provided by libdatrwxx for input and output.

18.10.2016 (769a6860d): libstfinv and soutifu

  Support semicolons as alternative to commas as field delimiters.

25.08.2016 (f4e76d439): tijerasxx

  FIX: Correctly handle input data with sample index range not starting at
  index zero (which commonly is the case for binary data compiled by 
  aynextract).

23.07.2016 (245aa3432): libstfinv and soutifu

  libstfinv provides a new feature: Procedures operating in the Fourier domain
  can taper the impulse response of the source time function correction
  filter, in order to remove acausal signals or unwanted coda.

12.07.2016 (fcc2520e9): libdatrwxx: - new error message format
                                    - fix: usec field in mseed can carry sign

  Let libdatrwxx output more user-friendly error messages. These messages can
  contain more detailed and comprehensive information regarding the cause of
  the error message and can provide hints how to handle the situation.

  Evaluate usec field in [1001] Data Extension Blockette as a value which may
  be negative. Introduce a consistency check to test for usec being in the
  range specified by SEED V2.4 Manual (August 2012, page 124).

06.07.2016 (4342d3a79): libdatrwxx provides new format modifiers

  Format modifiers skipcheck and nonfatal which can be applied to the mseed
  format provide user control over consistency checks to be applied to
  MiniSEED data.

27.06.2016 (7ffa0fa1d): libtfxx provides hexdump function
           (0d462617e): fix libdatrwxx

  libdatrwxx used to fail when reading MiniSEED data recorded by recent
  EarthData Loggers. These data contains MiniSEED records which are only
  partly filled with data samples. The library has to read properly past each
  record before operating on the next one. This fix solves issue #21 and #23.

23.03.2016 (9d9866d5c): add toy example for lisousi

25.02.2016 (32a3ac206): fix errors in documentation of lisousi

  The offset dependent scaling factor was wrong incorrectly specified in the
  online documentation.

08.02.2016 (33d32e44b): fix zero-offset scaling issue in refract

  refract used to fail in multiple ways is zero-offset traces were to be
  scaled with an offset dependent factor. With this commit refract is advanced
  to version 4.14 which is robust against zero-offset traces. For scaling
  exponents larger than zero any zero offset trace is scaled to a straight
  line as is expected to for the scaling definition. Negative exponents are
  inhibited.

04.11.2015 (db684f2e1): pamo supports various input file formats

27.10.2015 (b95726e01): Make Seitosh less system specific

  Explicitely use /bin/bash and make use of printf (instead of echo command
  with non-standard options).

26.10.2015 (e1816be7d): Add step-by-step example for lisousi

19.10.2015 (bfef3205e): Revision of end-user documentation of libstfinv

  The end-user documentation supplied by libstfinv is completely revised. New
  usage() functions are introduced. Program 'onlinehelp' (source is in
  libstfinv/tests/onlinehelp.cc) outputs the new texts. soutifu is updated to
  make use of the new usage functions.

21.09.2015 (66d134190): Bug fix in lisousi

  Trim convolution result to reasonable index range (784484c40).

19.07.2015 (f58ebd580, 088bc064ba): New options for stuplo

  Implement new options for winplot emulation:
   -py          display positive values only
   -n1 n        set first sample to plot to n'th sample
                for each input time series
   -n2 n        set last sample to plot to n'th sample
                for each input time series
                n=0 means: last sample read from file
   -ra          remove average of each input time series
