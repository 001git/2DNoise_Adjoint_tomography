Operation
---------
This program controls the Thies DL1 data logger through a serial port
interface. I runs in an infinite loop.

Each morning at approximately 1:00 UT the data logger's clock is synchronized
with the time of the system the program is running on. The timing precision
cannot be better than +-1s. Its accuracy will depend on the system time of the
host running DL1logger.

The program maintains data files:
1. A dump of raw DL1 data tables
2. Data files in specified formats (as requested by option '-datatypes')
The daily files are created at about 1:00 UT. The files containing the current
day's data are updated after an interval specified by option '-interval'.

To ensure that no data is missed in case of unexpected termination of the
program, the date of the last complete data file is stored in a memory file
specified by the '-memory' option.

All messages are written to the system log. If the '-verbose' option is
selected, standard message are also sent to the terminal. The messages are
tagged with "DL1logger" mapped to uniform sampling with 60s sampling interval.
The DL1 provides samples at the end of a full minute. The value for the past
minute is mapped to the middle of the past minute (at 30s).
