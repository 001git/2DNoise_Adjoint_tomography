lisousi: Line Source Simulation
============================================================================

Purpose of lisousi
------------------

Line-source simulation: Transform field data to apparent line-source generated
waveforms in preparation for Cartesian 2D full-waveform inversion.

Seismic field data is excited by point sources (e.g. hammer blows).
Full waveform inversion (FWI) approaches which make use of Cartesian 2D
forward modeling implicitly use a line source to fit the observed data.
Therefore recorded waveforms must be transformed to simulate equivalent
line-source generated data prior to application of 2D FWI.

lisousi offers several single-trace approaches for vertical component and
radial component data excited by vertical hammer blows or explosions.
Single-trace approaches can be applied to each seismic trace individually in
contrast to integral transform approaches, which require data from a complete
profile. Single-trace approaches have the benefit, that they are independent
of geophone layout and that they perform reasonably well for data recorded on
laterally heterogeneous structures. On the downside they must estimate the
wave number from sample time and receiver offset. They inherently are
approximations, most of them being derived from the acoustic wave Green's
function. Nevertheless, they perform surprisingly well on data from
visco-elastic wave propagation in heterogeneous structures.

Features
--------

 - Fourier domain or time domain application of convolution filter (selectable)
 - Selectable scaling optimized for either direct waves, non-dispersive waves,
   or reflected waves
 - Selectable delay of time-domain taper to match source wavelet centroid
   delay
 - Hybrid transformation for cases where near-offset traces suffer from
   delayed taper
 - Ability to read a variety of input formats including SeismicUn*x and raw
   ASCII (through libdatrwxx)

Installation
------------

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.


The Makefile supports program compilation and linking. Some binary libraries
are required. 

The command
  make all
will compile and install the binary executables as well as the doxygen
documentation.

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:
  LOCLIBDIR           defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR       defines location of C/C++ header files (prototypes)
  LOCBINDIR           defines location of binary executables
  TF_WWWBASEDIR       defines location of doxygen output

Dependencies:
  Compilers required to build the programs:
    C++ compiler
    C/C++ preprocessor
    doxygen (required to process source code documentation)
  
  Seitosh libraries required to compile the code:
    libaff
    libtime
    libseife
    libfourier
    liblinearxx
    libgsexx
    libdatrwxx
    libsffxx
    libtsxx
    libtfxx
