fidase: prepare a homogeneous data set from individual shot files
============================================================================

fidase provides means to combine data from several shallow seismic shots to
one single homogeneous data set. The program supports offset dependent
tapering, trace selection, stacking and destacking and renaming of channels.
A special feature is the rescaling of source amplitudes. 

If the subsurface structure is predominantly depth dependent, the data only
depend on source to receiver offset, not on absolute location in the profile.
To add more offset values and make the profile denser, the shots a different
locations can be combined, while leaving the receivers at their positions.

Note that fidase has a successor: fidasexx
fidasexx is superior in rescaling shot amplitudes.

Installation
------------

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.

The Makefile supports program compilation and linking. Some binary libraries
are required. 

The command
  make all
will compile and install the binary executables. 

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:
  LOCLIBDIR        defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR    defines location of C/C++ header files (prototypes)
  TF_WWWBASEDIR    defines location of doxygen output (used by some libraries)

Dependencies:
 
  extern libraries/packages needed to compile the code
    PGPLOT
    liblapack
    liblas
    libstdc++
 
  Seitosh libraries required to compile the code:
    libtf         provides libtf.a
    libsffu       provides libsffu.a
    libtime       provides libtime_trad.a and libtime++.a
    libgsexx      provides libgsexx.a
    libaff        provides libaff.a
    libts         provides libts.a
    libfapidxx    provides libfapidxx.a libfapidxx.so
    libdatrwxx    provides libdatrwxx.a libdatrwxx.so
    libsff        provides libsff.a
