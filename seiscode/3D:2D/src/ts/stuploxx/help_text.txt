# REVISIONS and CHANGES 
#    18/03/2015   V1.0   Thomas Forbriger (thof)
#                        mention all implemented options
#                        not implemented options are given in comments only
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# basic options
-v           be verbose
-D           debug mode
-device dev  use PGPLOT device dev
#
# interactive mode options
-interactive interactive mode
-hdevice dev use PGPLOT device dev for hardcopies
-hcommand c  issue command string c after hardcopy
#
# repeat mode options
-repeat[=i]  repeat plot with new data every i seconds.
-repcmd c    issue command string c in repeat more prior to each repetition
             this command will also be issued before re-reading data
             in interactive mode
# not yet implemented options
## -lwts l      set line width of time scale
## -chts h      set character height of time scale
## -lwtg l      set line width of time scale grid lines
##              no time scale grid is plotted if option is not set
## 
## -spp p       set panel separation as a fraction of total plot height
## -lwpb l      set line width of panel boxes
##              no panel boxes are plotted if option is not set
## 
## -chy h       set character height of ordinate scale
##              no ordinate scale is plotted if option is not set
## 
## -lwyg l      set line width for ordinate grid lines
##              no ordinate grid lines are plotted if option is not set
## -lwys l      set line width ordinate scale
#
# title control options
-title n     set title for plot to 'n'
-tstitle     set text scaling factor for title
#
# plot panel label options
-labu        underline graph label with appropriate line style
-labc        print graph label in appropriate colour
-labe        erase background of graph label
-labh h      set height of graph label as a fraction of panel height
-labr        reserve space for graph label; if plot range is set
             approrpiately, graph and label will not be overlapping;;
             this is useful together with chart stepping in
             particular
#
# further options
-npanels n   plot at least n panels
-datesep s   use s as separator between day, month, and year
-lyd d       set separation of ordinate unit label from graph box edge

#
# file specific options
file         SFF waveform data file name
#
# file type, trace and panel selection
t:n          can be used to select traces from file
f:format     select file format
p:n          places file data in panel n
#
# scaling options
s:min,max    set fixed limits for ordinate scale
sf:f         set limits for ordinate scale range to fraction f of the
             dataset's amplitude
cs:v         activate chart stepper function and step at fraction v
             of full plot range
#
# plot parameter options
lw:w         set line width to w
ls:s         set line style to s
ci:i         use color index i
r:r,g,b      set color in rgb mode
h:h,l,s      set color in hls mode
#
# file label options
n:n          set label to n
             the label may contain patterns that will be replaced
             (see below)
ch:h         set chart stepping hysteresis as a fraction of range
u:units      set label for ordinate scale
a:a          additional annotation to graph; this will be appended
             to the graph label in ordinary line style; duplicate
             identical annotations will be discarded
A:a          additional annotation to graph; this will be prepended
             to the graph label in ordinary line style; duplicate
             identical annotations will be discarded

Patterns that may be used in data trace labels are:
%F     file name
%NF    number of file on command line
%NT    number of trace in file
%D     date of first sample
%T     time of first sample
%UT    time of first sample including microsecond
%S     station identifier
%C     channel identifier
%A     auxiliary identifier
%I     instrument identifier
%%     will be replaced by a literal '%'
