synt/misc: miscellaneous programs for time series synthesis
============================================================================

Most programs provide output in Stuttgart File Format (SFF). Three programs
are also available with alternatively linked binary executables providing all
data formats supported by libdatrwxx:
dispfieldx, lambx, and siggenx

Physical simulation of seismic wave propagation
-----------------------------------------------
lamb        Synthetic seismograms as solution to Lamb's problem (1904)

Response of simple oscillatory systems to a transient force
-----------------------------------------------------------
coupledoscillators      Two coupled mass-spring oscillators
hamres      Standard linear solid 
kette       Chain of coupled mass-spring systems

Demonstration of signal properties
----------------------------------
modeinterference  Demonstrate the effect of interference of surface wave modes
      with different wave number at a given freqeuncy
phasedsignals     Demonstrate the effect of the phase spectrum for signals
      with identical amplitude spectrum    

Multi-offset test wavefield
---------------------------
dispfield   Test wavefield with ad hoc dispersion
planefield  Test wavefield of harmonic (single frequency) plane waves
teswf       Non-dispersive transient signal with given slowness

Test signal generators
----------------------
siggen      Provides a variety of fully adjustable test signals
tesiff      Provides a fixed set of test signals with adjustable sampling

============================================================================

Installation
------------

For compilation instructions see README.md and INSTALL.md in the root
directory.

The Makefile supports program compilation and linking. Some binary libraries
are required. 

The command
  make all
will compile and install the binary executables as well as the doxygen
documentation.

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:
  LOCLIBDIR           defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR       defines location of C/C++ header files (prototypes)
  LOCBINDIR           defines location of binary executables
  TF_WWWBASEDIR       defines location of doxygen output

Dependencies:
  Compilers required to build the programs:
    Fortran compiler
    C++ compiler
    C/C++ preprocessor
    doxygen (required to process source code documentation)

  external libraries/packages needed to compile the code
    PGPLOT (libpgplot)
    liblapack:      linear algebra package
    libblas:        basic linear algebra functions
    libgsl:         GNU scientific library (libgsl, libgslcblas)
    The header files for these libraries are required as well. Under OpenSuSE
    you have to install the respective devel packages.
  
  Seitosh libraries required to compile the code:
    libaff
    libdatrwxx
    libfapidxx
    libgsexx
    libsff
    libsffu
    libsffxx
    libtf
    libtime (libtime, libtime++)
