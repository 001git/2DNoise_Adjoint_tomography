synt/tides: compute tidal signals
============================================================================

Most programs provide output in Stuttgart File Format (SFF).

gez.f currently does not compile

Simulation of tidal acceleration adn Earth's response
-----------------------------------------------------
bfotide     Response of a spherically symmetric, elastic Earth to
            tidal forcing, based on ephemerides (Longman) and Love numbers
gez         Rigid Earth's tidal acceleration based on JPL ephemerides (Roger
            Broucke) of the Moon (Brown) and the Sun (Newcomb)

tidesff     Combines bfotide and gez in one program and provides SFF output

============================================================================

Installation
------------

For compilation instructions see README.md and INSTALL.md in the root
directory.

The Makefile supports program compilation and linking. Some binary libraries
are required. 

The command
  make all
will compile and install the binary executables as well as the doxygen
documentation.

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:
  LOCLIBDIR           defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR       defines location of C/C++ header files (prototypes)
  LOCBINDIR           defines location of binary executables
  TF_WWWBASEDIR       defines location of doxygen output

Dependencies:
  Compilers required to build the programs:
    Fortran compiler

  Seitosh libraries required to compile the code:
    libsff
    libsffu
    libtf
    libtime (libtime, libtime++)
