 * \section concept Concept of the library 
 * The library provides seismic data file reading modules for several data formats. Functionality
 * for all formats is provided through a common interface defined in class datrw::idatstream. All
 * format specific classes are derived from this base. The class datrw::ianystream  has the same
 * common interface but provides an inheritance transparent constructor mechanism. Programs making
 * use of datrw::ianystream  for reading seismic data will directly benefit from each additional
 * waveform format added to libdatrwxx without the need of changing the source code of the
 * library. Just link against libdatrwxx and go...
 *
 * See libdatrwxx coming together with any2matlab for a current list of
 * supported file format types.
 *
 * Each format specific module will be placed into its own namespace, like datrw::hpmo. There you
 * will find specific functions like datrw::hpmo::readdata. The interface provided through these
 * functions is specific to the data format. However, for each format we provide a class derived
 * from datrw::idatstream, like datrw::ihpmostream. Being derived from a common base class all
 * these format specific classes provide a common interface once defined in datrw::idastream. This
 * interface handles data in terms of SFF (Stuttgart File Format) data elements (like INFO lines and
 * FREE blocks). Thus the format specific input classes perform the conversion from the specific
 * format to SFF. Any data that does not fit into SFF, must be dropped or may be only passed via the
 * FREE blocks. All SFF data elements not present in the specific format must be replaced by default
 * values.
 *
 * datrw::idatstream behaves like an input stream for SFF data elements. Appropriate input
 * operators are presented in namespace datrw. All derived classes and datrw::ianystream provide
 * the same interface and operator set. datrw::ianystream is not derived from datrw::idatstream.
 * It rather serves as a handle to any class derived from datrw::idatstream. Anyway
 * datrw::ianystream provides the same interface. Consider to use datrw::sequentialtracereader
 * instead of datrw::ianystream since it provides higher efficiency when reading several traces
 * from the same file.
 *
 * \section any2matlab any2matlab.mexa64
 * This program allows the import of the supported dataformats in MATLAB via MEX.
 *
 * \c any2matlab.mexa64 is the built program of any2matlab.cc, which had been compiled with the MATLAB
 * mex compiler.
