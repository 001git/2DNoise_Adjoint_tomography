any2matlab: read seismic data into Matlab struct
============================================================================
Purpose of any2matlab
---------------------

any2matlab provides a function which can be called from a Matlab script in
order to read seismic time series data into Matlab structs. The function makes
use of libdatrwxx and supports reading of all data formats implemented in
libdatrwxx. Run the command

  libdatrwxxinfo

(in a command shell, not in Matlab) for further information.

============================================================================
Installation
------------

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.

The Makefile supports program compilation and linking. Some binary libraries
are required. 

The command
  make all
will compile and install the binary executables as well as the doxygen
documentation.

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:
  LOCLIBDIR           defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR       defines location of C/C++ header files (prototypes)
  LOCBINDIR           defines location of binary executables
  TF_WWWBASEDIR       defines location of doxygen output

Dependencies:
  Compilers required to build the programs:
    C++ compiler
    C/C++ preprocessor
    doxygen (required to process source code documentation)
  
  Seitosh libraries required to compile the code:
    libdatrwxx
    libsffxx
    libgsexx
    libaff
    libtime

The binary executable of any2matlab receives an extension of the filename
depending on the hardware platform of the host system:

  any2matlab.mexa64 for x86_64 (64-bit system)

or 

  any2matlab.mexglx for x86 (32-bit system).

The binary executable is placed in directory $LOCBINDIR/matlab/
To make it known to Matlab the environment variable MATLABPATH must be set
appropriately:

  export MATLABPATH=$LOCBINDIR/matlab:$MATLABPATH

See http://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/userpath.html#zmw57dd0e893915

Notes regarding matlab mex compiler
-----------------------------------
The max compiler provided by Matlab reports not being compatible with every
version of GCC. So far we observe no problems when compiling any2matlab with
more recent versions of GCC details on compatibility can be found at

http://de.mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2016a/index.html?sec=glnxa64

and similar pages for other releases of Matlab.

The current Makefile does not distinguish between different versions of GCC.

Compilation and installation will only take place, if Matlab is installed.
The Makefile contains a mechanism to check for an existing binary executable
called matlab.

Conflict with pdftex package
----------------------------
As JÃ¶rn Gross pointed out a potential conflict with another program called mex
which is part of the pdfTex package and not of MATLAB. The Makefile contains a
mechanism to read the proper path to the mex compiler from the output of
matlab. If desired this path can be set manually by setting the variable MEX
on the make command line.

============================================================================
Documentation
-------------

User documentation is provided in a LaTeX formatted file in subdirectory doc.

Source code documentation is provided within the source code and can be
compiled with doxygen. For this purpose simply run

  make doxydoc

Apart from html-output doxygen also produces a man-page, which can be
addressed by

  man -M $TF_WWWBASEDIR/any2matlab/man any2matlab.cc

After adding $TF_WWWBASEDIR/any2matlab/man to the MANPATH environment
variable, the man-page will be available without passing the path name to the
man command.
