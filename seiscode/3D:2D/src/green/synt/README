============================================================================

This directory caontains programs to calculate synthetic Fourier-Bessel
expansion coefficients for a given model of subsurface structure and to
calculate synthetic waveform data for a given set of Fourier-Bessel expansion
coefficients. The programs are useful in the context of the inversion of
shallow seismic wavefields. The repository contains software for a two-stage
approach.

 1. Modified Fourier-Bessel transformation for shallow seismic data
 2. Inversion of Fourier Bessel expansion coeffcients.

The intermediate data in this approach are Fourier-Bessel expansion
coefficients expressing the recorded waveform data. 

The Makefile supports the following binaries:

  dig
    A program to produce artificial coefficients in the file format of
    Fourier-Bessel expansion coefficients which are derived from a set of
    dispersion curves. This is used to enter the second stage of inversion
    from a set of dispersion curves without a wavefield transformation of
    actual waveform data.
  gresy
    The program gresy calculates synthetic waveform data from a given set of
    Fourier-Bessel expansion coefficients. 
  gresyx
    This version is linked against libdatrwxx and supports output in
    different file formats other than SFF.
  gresynoise
    A version of gresy which convolves waveform data with gaussian noise. This
    program calculates synthetic noise seismograms for H/V analyses. For this
    purpose it reads Fourier-Bessel expansion coefficients for the response to
    a vertical force or explosion from files produced by the program syg for
    vertical component and radial component displacement fields. 
  syg 
    Calculates synthetic Fourier-Bessel expansion coefficients with the
    reflectivity method. 
  rhesyg
    Calculates synthetic Fourier-Bessel expansion coefficients with the
    reflectivity method. This version uses the physically correct rheology of
    a standard-linear-solid. 
  wsyg
    This version of syg is linked against libwrefsub, a version which
    supports models of subsurface structure with a liquid layer on top.

Installation
------------

This software is part of the Seitosh project. See
https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh
for general installations instructions.

The Makefile supports program compilation and linking. Some binary libraries
are required. 

The command
  make all
will compile and install the binary executables. 

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:
  LOCLIBDIR           defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR       defines location of C/C++ header files (prototypes)
  LOCBINDIR           defines location of binary executables

Dependencies:
  
  Seitosh libraries required to compile the code:
    libaff libdatrwxx libfapidxx libgrrefsub libgsexx librefpar librheology
    libsff libsffu libsffxx libtf libtime libtime++ libwrefsub libtfxx
  The libraries can be obtained from where you got the current package from
  either in a single package containing all the libraries or in individual
  packages.

  Further libraries which are required are:
    libgsl
    libgslcblas
  Both are part of the GSL (GNU Scientific Library; www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
