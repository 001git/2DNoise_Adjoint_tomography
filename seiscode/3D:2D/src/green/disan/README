green/disan
programs to calculate wavefield transforms and for dispersion analysis
============================================================================

this directory contains the following programs:

greda:          dispersion analysis, wavefield transformation
grereso:        resolution analysis for wavefield transformation
gabor:          group traveltime analysis, Gabor matrix
phadi:          classical dispersion analysis using Fourier phases only
hivgabor:       calculate H/V from gabor output
hivexpanco:     claculate H/V from Fourier Bessel coefficients

corresponding binaries being able to read SU and other formats:
gaborx, phadix, gredax

============================================================================

Installation:

For installation instructions see INSTALL.md in the root directory or
the projects wiki at
https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh/wikis/home

The Makefile supports program compilation and linking. Some binary libraries
are required. 

The command
  make all
will compile and install the binary executables as well as the documentation.

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:
  LOCLIBDIR           defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR       defines location of C/C++ header files (prototypes)
  LOCBINDIR           defines location of binary executables
  TF_WWWBASEDIR       defines location of doxygen output (used by some libraries)

libraries/packages needed to compile the code

extern libraries/packages needed to compile the code
  PGPLOT
  liblapack:      linear algebra package
  libblas:        basic linear algebra functions
  libgsl:         GNU scientific library

Seitosh libraries required to compile the code:
  libsff:         package containing libsff.a
  libtime:        package containing libtime.a
  libtf:          package containing libtf.a
  libts:          package containing libts.a
  libsffu:        package containing libsffu.a
  you can obtain the latter packages from where you obtained the present code

to link binaries able to read SU data additional libraries are required:
  libfapidxx.a
  libdatrwxx.a
  libsffxx.a
  libgsexx.a
  libtime++.a
  libaff.a
