green/grepg
Display Fourier Bessel expansion coefficients
============================================================================

This directory contains the following program:

grepg:          display Fourier Bessel expansion coefficients
                like created by greda or syg

libraries/packages needed to compile the code
PGPLOT:         source code can be obtained from
                www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/

libtf:          package containing libtf.a
you can obtain the latter package from where you obtained the present code

Installation:

This software is part of project Seitosh. See
https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh
for general installation instructions.

The Makefile supports program compilation and linking. Some binary libraries
are required. 

The command
  make all
will compile and install the binary executables as well as the documentation.

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:
  LOCLIBDIR           defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR       defines location of C/C++ header files (prototypes)
  LOCBINDIR           defines location of binary executables
