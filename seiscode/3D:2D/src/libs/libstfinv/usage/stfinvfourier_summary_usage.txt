Procedures in the Fourier domain
--------------------------------
Options and parameters in common for procedures in the Fourier domain:
  fpow2              use power of two for number of coefficients
  fdiv=d             use integer multiple of d for number of coefficients
  fpad=f             padding factor
  tshift=d           delay source correction filter wavelet by d (in seconds)
                     this is applied only to the waveform of the impulse
                     response of the correction filter after application to
                     synthetic data (has no effect on convolved data)
  irtap=t1,t2,t3,t4  taper impulse response of correction filter
                     this is applied to the correction filter before
                     application to synthetic data (affects convolved data)
