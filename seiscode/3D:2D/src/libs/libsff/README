============================================================================
SFF --- Stuttgart File Format I/O Fortran software library
============================================================================

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.

This is a library containing some fortran subroutines to read and write
data in SFF (Stuttgart File Format) which is based on GSE2.0. This
library is provided as a static binary library:

libsff.a          static library to be used with gfortran


Installation instructions
-------------------------
The command make all will compile and install the binary executables as well 
as the doxygen documentation.

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:

  LOCLIBDIR           defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR       defines location of C/C++ header files (prototypes)
  LOCBINDIR           defines location of binary executables

Dependencies:
------------- 
 Compilers required to build the programs:
    Fortran compiler (gfortran is currently supported)

  The library does not require any other prerequisites.
   
Tests and examples:
  teststuff tfullread tfullwrite tservice tskipdata
  
Source code and file format documentation:
  sff.doc, libsff.doc (both produced by 'make doc')


Documentation is provided in the source file (stuff.f) and can be
extracted the files:

sff.doc           contains the definition of the SFF
libsff.doc        contains a quick reference to the routines in the library

C prototypes are provided in sff.h for C-code which links against this library.
