librefpar: read reflectivity parameter files
--------------------------------------------
libs/librefpar
============================================================================

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.

librefpar reads parameter files used to configure the reflectivity program
refmet. Some of these files are used by other programs too. For this reason
the file reading subroutines are provided separate from the refmet code in
this library. Until 24/09/2014 the code was part of the refmet package.

Installation

  LOCLIBDIR       Defines the path where the binary library will be
