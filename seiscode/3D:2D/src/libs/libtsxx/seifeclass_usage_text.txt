available filters (see seife.f by Erhard Wielandt):
lpb t0 o   Butterworth low-pass of order o
hpb t0 o   Butterworth high-pass of order o
lp2 t0 h   2nd order low-pass
hp2 t0 h   2nd order high-pass
bp2 t0 h   2nd order band-pass
lp1 t0     1st order low-pass
hp1 t0     1st order high-pass
le2 t0s hs t0 h
           2nd order low-pass equalizer
he2 t0s hs t0 h
           2nd order high-pass equalizer
le1 t0s t0 1st order low-pass equalizer
he1 t0s t0 1st order high-pass equalizer
int t0     integrate with time constant t0
           (t0=0.: sets t0=1.)
dif t0     differentiate with time constant t0
           (t0=0.: sets t0=1.)
tid n      remove tides (tides are interpolated over n samples) 
           (n=0: interpolation over 5 minutes)
first      remove value of first sample
