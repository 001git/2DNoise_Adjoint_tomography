libtsxx: time series filters, tapers, etc.
============================================================================

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.

This library provides modules for time series analysis. In particular this are
functions that also need seismic trace header data (like the sampling
interval) additional to the time series samples themselves. Provided are
recursive filters (i.e. an interface to seife), FIR decimating filters,
interpolation filters, tapers, containers for time series data together with
header data, and more.

Installation
------------
 environment variables:

  LOCINCLUDEDIR   Defines the path where header files will be copied for
                  usage in your own projects. You will pass this path to
                  the precompiler with the -I option.
  LOCLIBDIR       Defines the path where the binary library will be
                  placed.
  TF_WWWBASEDIR   Defines the path to your personal homepage. That's the
                  place where doxygen output will be written too (see
                  inthe Makefile).

make all             installs headers, binary libraries and documentation

Dependencies:
-------------
  Compilers required to build the programs:
    C++ compiler
    C/C++ preprocessor
    doxygen (required to process source code documentation)

  Seitosh libraries required to compile the code:
    direct dependencies:
      libaff, libgsexx, libtime, libdatrwxx, libsffxx, libcseife
    the test program additionally requires:
      libtfxx

  Further non-standard libraries required to compile the code:
    - the C++ standard template library (STL)
    - libgsl (libgsl, libgslcblas)

Detailed documentation is provided through doxygen source code. See target
doxydoc in the Makefile.
