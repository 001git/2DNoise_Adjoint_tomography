C++ library libtfxx
============================================================================

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.

A collection of miscellaneous code frequently used by C++ programs in
Seitosh. 

This library contains smaller and independent sets of classes and modules.
They should provide stable and reliable interfaces and sematics. Some of them
will be copied from libclass which was more for experimenting purposes. The
modules provide handling of commandline options and arguments, I/O byte
swapping, I/O for Fortran binary files, error handling, and more.

The home of this software suite is
https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh/tree/master/src/libs/libtfxx

Please send bug reports and suggestions to
Thomas.Forbriger@kit.edu

Installation instructions
-------------------------
The command make all will compile and install the binary executables 
as well as the doxygen documentation.

Environment variables control where the results are stored and where
libraries and library header files are expected:

  LOCLIBDIR           defines location of binary libraries
  LOCINCLUDEDIR       defines location of C/C++ header files (prototypes)
  LOCBINDIR           defines location of binary executables
  TF_WWWBASEDIR       defines location of doxygen output

Dependencies:
-------------
  Compilers required to build the programs:
    C++ compiler
    C/C++ preprocessor
    doxygen (required to process source code documentation)

  Seitosh libraries required to compile the code:
    non; the library is self-contained

  Further non-standard libraries required to compile the code:
    - the C++ standard template library (STL)
    - libboost (libboost_regex)
    - libgsl (libgsl, libgslcblas)

Tests and examples are provided in subdirectory tests

The source code itself depends only on common system libraries and the STL.

Detailed documentation is provided through doxygen source code. See target
doxydoc in the Makefile.
