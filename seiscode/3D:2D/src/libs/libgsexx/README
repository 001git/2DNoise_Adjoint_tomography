GSEXX --- GSE++ library to read and write GSE waveforms 
============================================================================

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.

The library defines a module GSE2::waveform. This module containes classes
(TWID2, TCHK2) that hold GSE2 format elements and can handle their input and
output to data files. Further it contains functions to read and write waveform
data in subformat CM6. A major advantage of the design of this module is, that
it supports sample by sample reading and writing. The library does not need or
use an intermediate character buffer for encoding or decoding waveform data in
CM6 format.

The library has the primary purpose to supply the CM6 time series
input/output layer for reading and writing SFF data. But it is designed to
be supplemented with other GSE2.1 elements and functionality in the future.


Installation instructions
-------------------------

To install the library use target install

To instell the library together with the doxygen documentation,
use target all. Note that this requires doxygen to be installed.

Look at gsexx_write_example.cc for a brief example on using the code.

The binary library libgsexx.a will be placed in $(LOCLIBDIR). The prototype
file gsexx.h will be linked to a copy in $(LOCINCLUDEDIR). 

The doxygen documentation will be placed in $(TF_WWWBASEDIR). 

Dependencies
------------
The library code itself depends only on common system libraries.


Detailed documentation is provided through doxygen source code. See target
doxydoc in the Makefile.
