This library provides functions to calculate Fourier-Bessel expansion
coefficients of seismograms using the reflectivity method. The solution
contains the full wavefield including far- and nearfield for a moment tensor
point source. The original code if courtesy of J. Ungerer (refseis.f 1990). 
It was modified and supplemented by T. Forbriger (refmet.f 1997).
