DATRWXX --- seismic data file reading and writing
============================================================================

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.

The library provides seismic data file reading and writing
modules for several data formats. 
Functionality for all formats is provided through a common interface defined
in classes datrw::idatstream and datrw::odatstream.
All format specific classes are derived from these bases.
The class datrw::ianystream has a same common interface like
datrw::idatstream
but provides an inheritance transparent constructor mechanism.
The same is the case for datrw::oanystream and datrw:odatstream.
Programs making use of datrw::ianystream and of datrw::oanystream
for reading seismic data will
directly benefit from each additional waveform format added to libdatrwxx
without the need of changing the source code of the library. 
Just link against libdatrwxx and go...


Installation instructions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Makefile targets
----------------
To install the library use target install

To install the library together with the doxygen documentation,
use target all.

Environment variables
---------------------
The doxygen documentation will be placed in $(TF_WWWBASEDIR).

The prototype files will be copied to $(LOCINCLUDEDIR). 

Dependencies
------------
To compile libdatrwxx a c++ compiler is required. 
The software is testet with the gnu c++ compiler.

Other libraries that are required to compile libdatrwxx:
libaff, libgsexx, libtime++, libsffxx

doxygen is required to produce the source code documentation

For test code and examples libtfxx is required in addition.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detailed documentation is provided through doxygen source code. See target
doxydoc in the Makefile.

General information for all libraries is provided through 
README.compile and README.dependencies
