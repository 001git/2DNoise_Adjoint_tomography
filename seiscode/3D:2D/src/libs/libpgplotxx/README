PGPLOT++ --- C++ interface for PGPLOT 
============================================================================

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.

This provides a C++ interface to the FORTRAN PGPLOT library. It is based on 
the C-interface (cpgplot.h) coming with the library.

Installation
------------
 environment variables:
  LOCINCLUDEDIR   Defines the path where header files will be copied for
                  usage in your own projects. You will pass this path to
                  the precompiler with the -I option.
  LOCLIBDIR       Defines the path where the binary library will be
                  placed.
  TF_WWWBASEDIR   Defines the path to your personal homepage. That's the
                  place where doxygen output will be written too (see
                  in the Makefile).

make all             installs headers, binary libraries and documentation

Dependencies
------------
This library requires code from libaff.
External dependency is PGPLOT.
The testprogram requires libtfxx in addition.

When compiling the PGPLOT library you must use the same Fortran compiler you
use for the other code and in particular pass the options -ff2c and
-fno-backslash to the the gfortran compiler. See
https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh/wikis/doc_PGPLOT
or contrib/pgplot/README.pgplot (as seen from the root directory of Seitosh)
for assistance.

Detailed documentation is provided through doxygen source code. See target
doxydoc in the Makefile.
