SERIALXX --- a small library to access serial ports in C++
============================================================================

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.

This library was initiated to provide access to our Thies pluviograph
(rainfall recorder) at BFO.
It will first provide only features required together with this instrument.
The general design, however, supports more general usage in the future.

The main interface is the SerialPort class.
It supports opening of a serial port, port parameter configuration, and
reading and writing from and to the port.

Installation
------------
 environment variables:
  LOCINCLUDEDIR   Defines the path where header files will be copied for
                  usage in your own projects. You will pass this path to
                  the precompiler with the -I option.
  LOCLIBDIR       Defines the path where the binary library will be
                  placed.
  TF_WWWBASEDIR   Defines the path to your personal homepage. That's the
                  place where doxygen output will be written too (see
                  in the Makefile).

make all             installs headers, binary libraries and documentation

Dependencies
------------
This is a base library. It depends only on common system libraries.
The testprogram requires libtfxx in addition.


Detailed documentation is provided through doxygen source code. See target
doxydoc in the Makefile.
