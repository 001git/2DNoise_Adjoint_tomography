SFFXX --- reading and writing SFF from C++
============================================================================

This software is part of the project Seitosh. See README.1st in the root
directory of the collection or https://git.scc.kit.edu/Seitosh/Seitosh for
general installation instructions.

The library is designed to provide a tool for SFF (Stuttgart File Format)
writing and reading. It uses libgsexx for the GSE2 layer of SFF. While
libgsexx does not explicitely use an array class for time series, libsffxx
provides whole array reading and writing functionality. For this purpose
the library uses code from libaff.

A major advantage of the library is a feature of libgsexx. With this code
you can deal with time series of arbitrary length. In particular no
temporary character buffer for CM6 decoding and encoding is needed (like it
is in the Fortran library). This means, on the other hand, that the library
has no information to fill the nchar field of the DAST line.

Warning:
The library will write -1 to the nchar field of the DAST line. You will
need an updated version (2.00 or higher) of libstuff or libsff (Fortran
version) to read data files written with libsffxx to Fortran code. 

Installation instructions
-------------------------

To install the library use target install

To instell the library together with the doxygen documentation,
use target all. Note that this requires doxygen to be installed.
The doxygen documentation will be placed in $(TF_WWWBASEDIR). 

Look at sfftest.cc for a brief example on using the code.

The binary library libsffxx.a will be placed in $(LOCLIBDIR). The prototype
files will be copied to $(LOCINCLUDEDIR). 

Dependencies
------------
This library requires code from libgsexx, libaff, and libtime.
The testprogram sfftest requires libtfxx in addition.


Detailed documentation is provided through doxygen source code. See target
doxydoc in the Makefile.
