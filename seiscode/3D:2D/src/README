Seitosh source code directory
-----------------------------

files
-----
  compile.sh
    Shell script to compile and install all Seitosh components.
    Just run compile.sh to receive usage information.

  install_src_dirs.txt
    List of directories to be addressed by compile.sh for the installation of
    Seitosh components.

  README.compile
    A description of essential steps to take when compiling and installing
    Seitosh components.

  README.dependencies
    A description of internal and external dependencies between Seitosh
    components and libraries.

  README.make.variables
    A detailed description of variables commonly used in Makefile.

directories
-----------
  conv
    Data file conversion programs. Also contains the ThiesDL1 data recording
    program.

  green
    Programs to apply a Fourier-Bessel transformation or dispersion analysis
    to seismic data. These programs come along with plot programs and
    utilities. gremlin1 is a program for the inversion of Fourier-Bessel
    expansion coefficients and travel times to subsurface structure.

  libs
    Seitosh software libraries used by the main executables provided in other
    directories.

  matlab
    Code linking Matlab to Seitosh. Currently this directory contains which
    provides access to libdatrwxx functions from with in Matlab. This way
    various seismic data formats can be read from Matlab script files.

  python
    Programs written in python. Currently contains only a plot program for
    power spectral densities (which should better be placed elsewhere).

  synt
    Programs calculate synthetic seismic waveforms and travel times. It in
    particular contains a reflectivity program.

  ts
    Various programs to manipulate seismic data files and operate on seismic
    data. It contains wave form filter programs, data analysis preprocessing
    tools and plot programs.
